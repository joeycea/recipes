    <h2>Toasted bread with melted cheese inside</h2>
    <p>This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced cheese, and butter. 
        It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit 
        your taste preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices white bread</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</p></li>
            <h3>Tip</h3>
            <p>Pair this sandwich with homeade tomato soup.</p>
